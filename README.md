# Color-classifier-ML-model
A deep learning model that classifies colors based on RGB values using TensorFlow. It preprocesses data, builds a neural network, and achieves high accuracy in multi-class classification. Uses Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn for analysis. Future scope: CNNs, deployment as a web app. 🚀
🎨 Color Classifier ML Model
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Color Classification Machine Learning Model that predicts color categories based on RGB values. It uses a Neural Network built with TensorFlow to classify colors into 13 distinct categories, making it ideal for applications in image processing, design automation, and color-based analytics.

🚀 Features
✅ Multi-Class Classification – Classifies colors into 13 categories
✅ Deep Learning Model – Uses a Sequential Neural Network
✅ Optimized Training – Achieves high accuracy with Adam Optimizer
✅ Efficient Data Processing – Uses One-Hot Encoding for labels
✅ Visual Insights – Heatmap for correlation analysis

📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of RGB values (Red, Green, Blue) as features and corresponding color labels as targets.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
TensorFlow / Keras 🤖
NumPy & Pandas 📊
Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈
📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Preprocesses the dataset (One-Hot Encoding, Train-Test Split)
2️⃣ Builds a Neural Network with Dense Layers and ReLU activation
3️⃣ Trains the model using Categorical Crossentropy Loss
4️⃣ Evaluates performance and makes predictions on test data

🎯 Results
The model achieves high classification accuracy in predicting colors from RGB values.
